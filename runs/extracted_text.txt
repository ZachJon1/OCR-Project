Remotely sensed data and geographic information systems offer a potential solution to the
limitations of traditional flood models, Remotely sensed data have been used to monitor flood
events and assess urban infrastructure [16-18]. In Patro, et al. [19], the authors used MIKE flood
a flood modeling tool built by the Danish Hydraulic Institute and the river cross sections extracted
from the shuttle radar topography mission digital elevation model. Other authors including (20-
22], used satellite remote sensing data to create and calibrate hydrologic models for spatial flood
extent mapping.

Kourgialas and Karatzas (23), used geographic information system (GIS) data in modelling flood«
hazard areas based on flow accumulation, geology, elevation, land use, slope and rainfall intensity.
